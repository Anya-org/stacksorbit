# Prioritization of Recommendations

This document outlines the recommended prioritization for the proposed improvements to StacksOrbit.

## 1. UI Improvement (Highest Priority)

The highest priority is the improvement of the user interface.

*   **Reasoning:** The user explicitly requested to prioritize the UI first. The new Textual-based dashboard provides a significantly improved user experience for all users of the StacksOrbit tool, regardless of their development environment. It is a foundational improvement that will have the broadest impact.
*   **Status:** The `curses`-based dashboard has been successfully replaced with a new Textual-based dashboard.

## 2. VSX Integration (Secondary Priority)

The second priority is the development of a VS Code extension.

*   **Reasoning:** A VS Code extension will greatly enhance the developer experience for those who use VS Code as their primary editor. However, this feature benefits a specific subset of users. The UI improvement is a more general enhancement that should be completed first.
*   **Status:** A proposal for the VS Code extension has been created in `VSX_INTEGRATION.md`.
